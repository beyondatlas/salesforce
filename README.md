# The sales force deployment problem for teams of sales representatives within sales territories
This GitHub repository includes the code and data sets for an upcoming paper called “The sales force deployment problem for teams of sales representatives within sales territories.” It aims to address the sales force deployment problem by solving all four subproblems simultaneously: sales territory alignment, sales force location, sales resource allocation, and sales force sizing. The code and the numerical example from the paper can be easily replicated by pulling the repository. The only requirement is a valid license for Gurobi. To initialize the solvers, run the file 'init_solvers.jl' from the repository. Afterwards, you can start the file 'main_benchmark.jl' and you will be replicating our numerical study.
